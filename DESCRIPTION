Description: Implements the algorithm described in Trapnell,C. et al. (2010) <doi: 10.1038/nbt.1621>. This function takes a matrix read counts (RNA-Seq) data, feature lengths which can be retrieved using biomaRt, and the mean fragment lengths, which can be calculated using Picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics. It then return a matrix of FPKM normalised data by library size and feature effective length.
