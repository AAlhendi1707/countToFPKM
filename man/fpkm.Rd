Convert counts to Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM)
}

\usage{
fpkm (counts, featureLength, meanFragmentLength)
}

\arguments{
\item{counts}{A numeric matrix of raw feature counts}
\item{featureLength}{A numeric vector with feature lengths which can be obtained using biomaRt.
The length of items should be as the same of rows in read count matrix.}
\item{meanFragmentLength}{A numeric vector with mean fragment lengths, 
which can be calculated using Picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics.
The length of items should be as the same of columns in read count matrix.}
}

\value{
A data matrix normalized by library size and feature length.
}

\description{
fpkm() function returns a numeric matrix normalized by library size and feature length.

\details{
Implements the algorithm described in Trapnell,C. et al. (2010). "Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation". Nat. Biotechnol., 28, 511-515. doi: 10.1038/nbt.1621. This function takes a matrix of RNA-seq, read feature counts data
a numeric vector with feature lengths which can be retrieved using biomaRt, and A numeric vector with mean fragment lengths, which can be calculated using Picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics.
It then validates the lenght of input data and calculates effective lengths of features in each library to use in normlising the expression of each feature by sample library size and feature effective lenght. Please see the original manuscript for further details.
