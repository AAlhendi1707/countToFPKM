The DESCRIPTION file:
\packageDESCRIPTION{countToFPKM}
This package is to convert a numeric matrix of features (rows) and conditions (columns) with raw feature counts of RNA-seq data to fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads.
@param counts A numeric matrix of raw feature counts i.e. fragments assigned to each gene.
@param featureLength A numeric vector with feature lengths.
@param meanFragmentLength A numeric vector with mean fragment lengths.
@return fpkm A numeric matrix normalized by library size and feature length.
